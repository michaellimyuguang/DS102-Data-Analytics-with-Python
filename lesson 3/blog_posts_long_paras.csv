"It’s a major oversight that I haven’t written about New York City at all in the nearly two years I’ve had
              this travel blog. After all, New York was my home for 9 years, and as a result I know the city better than
              any other in the world."
"I guess New York is such an overwhelming topic, and to try to consolidate my 9 years of wisdom into a
              quick New York City itinerary in nearly impossible. I wanted to create an itinerary that represents a wide
              span of the city – not just the iconic museums and buildings, but the independent bookstores, cozy cafés,
              and authentic ethnic restaurants that really make New York what it is. This 5 day New York itinerary is
              made with first-time visitors in mind, but I think even New York veterans can find something new and
              exciting on this — especially on days 4 and 5, where I zero in on Queens and Brooklyn."
"5 days in New York City is kind of the bare minimum to get a good idea of Manhattan and still get to see
              a few of the other boroughs. Of course, there’s so much more you could do – 9 years in the city and I’m
              still discovering new sides to New York."
"Note: NYC is one of the safest big cities in the U.S., but I still highly recommend having travel
                insurance – especially if you are from outside the U.S. Due to a lack of a
                national health care system, obtaining health care in the U.S. is incredibly expensive if you have an
                accident or medical emergency while traveling abroad. I use and personally recommend World Nomads as my travel insurance to
                cover me all around the world."
"Your first day in New York should be about getting a feel for what makes this massive city so
              quintessentially New York. Union Square is as good a place as any to start – stepping off the
              subway here, for me, will always feel like peak New York. Whirl your head around and up and marvel at the
              buildings around you: you’re in freaking New York City!"
"Walk down Broadway, where you’ll pass a few sites worth noticing. The Strand on the corner of 12th
              and Broadway is my favorite bookstore in the world, boasting 18 miles of books. Stop in and browse the
              impressively curated selection of new and classic books on the ground floor, or go on a treasure hunt
              through the used dollar book carts out in front. There are also tons of rare first editions and
              leather-bound books for my fellow mega-book nerds."
"Just a few more blocks down on 10th, Grace Church is worth a
              quick stop into. I’ll always have a soft spot for this church since my first home in New York was right
              across the street (making hungover Sundays a painful situation – but I digress)."
"Keep walking and you’ll reach Houston Street, where SoHo begins. Walk around some of the cute side
              streets – I especially like Crosby, Mulberry, Mott, which are parallel to Broadway but to the East."
"There are countless cute boutiques to stop in if you want, but I just
              love the experience of walking down these streets. If you’re about due for a coffee, La Colombe on
              Lafayette between Prince & Houston makes some of the best espresso drinks on this planet. Book nerds
              like me will adore the Housing Works Bookstore & Café on Crosby between Prince & Houston as
              well."
"Street art lovers, take note: the SoHo/Nolita area is probably the best place for street art in
              Manhattan. There’s too much to list here, so here’s a super-comprehensive guide to the area’s best street art.
              
"
"If you’re into quirky contemporary art, now is a good time to pop over to the New Museum on
              Bowery between Stanton & Rivington. Otherwise, I recommend the Tenement Museum for a
              thoughtful look into what life was like for low-income New Yorkers and immigrants in the early 20th
              century."
"Once you’ve had sufficient time to wander Soho, you’ve probably worked up an appetite. You can safely
              skip Little Italy as it’s rather gimmicky and has been pretty much overrun by Chinatown. If you
              really want pizza, may I direct you instead to the oldest pizzeria in the United States, Lombardi’s
              on Spring Street."
"If you keep walking south, you’ll hit Canal Street which is pretty much the heart of Manhattan’s
              Chinatown. Try not to get lured into purchasing fake bags or sunglasses, and just gawk at the
              bustling atmosphere instead."
"Chinatown is fantastic and I could write an entire blog post all about it… but I’ll just give you a few
              quick recommendations here. For delicious hand-pulled noodles, try Spicy Village. Their big tray
              chicken is unmissable and will feed 2-3 hungry people for under $15 (and it’s BYOB as well, so just pick
              up some beers from the bodega next door if you want to feel peak New York). Note: Are you gluten-free?
                Check out this gluten-free guide to New
                  York."
"For dumplings, Joe’s Shanghai has the best soup dumplings I’ve
              been able to find in New York. If you’re into dim sum, Golden Unicorn is my absolute favorite but
              Nom Wah Tea Parlor and Jing Fong are also close contenders."
" Finally, I’m obsessed with Xi’an Famous Foods’ cumin lamb noodles, but there are locations all
              over the city so it may be best to save it for a different day of exploring. For dessert, I love the egg
              custard tarts at Tai Pan Bakery on Canal Street."
"After you’ve filled up and rested your feet a bit, continue downtown. One of my favorite buildings is a
              residential building by Frank Gehry, the architect behind Prague’s famous Dancing House. It’s located on
              8 Spruce Street right by City Hall."
"Continue on Wall Street and the Financial District. Here, you’ll find the Fearless Girl
              statue facing the iconic Wall Street Charging Bull statue."
"Keep walking a bit further south. You’ll be by the Staten Island Ferry which is free for all to
              take, with amazing views of New York’s harbor and its most famous resident — The Statue of Liberty.
            "
"If you prefer an up-close visit with Lady Liberty, you can schedule
                an actual tour of the Statue of Liberty or a combo
                Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island tour. "
" I haven’t done either as I’ve never actually gone to see the Statue of Liberty up close. It’s funny how
              when you live in New York, you often don’t get around to doing all the NYC itinerary musts. But I know
              many people want to see the Statue of Liberty as part of their New York trips, so if that’s something you
              want to do, I recommend booking your tour tickets in advance as they often sell out in high season
              (June-August and Christmas)."
"»» Book

"There’s also an affordable 60-minute
                cruise passing by the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, but it doesn’t let you visit either on
              foot. "
"There’s also a free option! Enter… the Staten Island Ferry, aka the best cheap-o hack for budget
              travelers and in-the-know New Yorkers who don’t want to spend like $40 every time someone comes to town.
            "
"If you want to hack a free trip to see the statue, which is what I always did when showing people around
              NYC, just hop on the Staten Island Ferry, ride it over, hop off and hop right back on (as there’s not much
              to see in Staten Island). Roundtrip, it will take you about one hour and will be a nice break from being
              on your feet so much!"
"An alternate idea (and truly on the other side of the price spectrum) is to take a helicopter tour over
              Manhattan!"
" It is a true bucket list item, and it is a great way to see the city (and Lady Liberty!) in a new light.
              Click
                to check prices and availability, keeping in mind that you should book in advance if this is
              definitely an activity you want to include on your NYC itinerary."
"After you’ve seen the Statue of Liberty, head a bit north to see the 9/11 Memorial, a must for
              anyone’s New York itinerary. It will make you feel quite somber to be in the presence of such tragedy, but
              it’s absolutely worth the visit and helps you understand what New Yorkers have been through and why they
              are so resilient."
"One thing that I think is so beautiful about New York’s spirit is that it’s unbreakable. When terrorists
              knocked down New York’s most important building and ended the lives of nearly 3,000 (and leaving many
              thousands of first responders with chronic health conditions), the city could have decided the pain was
              too great to rebuild."
"Instead, New York decided to build an even taller building in its place, to create a new symbol of
              strength and beauty. It took nearly the entire time I spent living in New York for the building to be
              built, but when it was finally done, it was beautiful. "
"Now the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere and the sixth
              largest in the world, visiting this beautiful observatory is a testament to New York’s ongoing strength,
              bravery, and grit. "
"Predictably, the lines to get in are insane, so I highly recommend booking
                a skip-the-line ticket which lets you skip the ticket queue (you’ll still have to wait for security
              and the elevator)."

"After you’ve seen the memorial, take a walk across the iconic Brooklyn Bridge – please,
              watch out for cyclists as many people do use this bridge to commute daily (or actively go out of
              their way to avoid it because the tourist traffic is so insufferable)."
" Once you’ve crossed, take a seat somewhere in Brooklyn Bridge Park and watch the sun go down
              for an epic sunset and stunning views of Downtown Manhattan."
"For dinner, the world is your oyster – this is New York, after all, one of the best places to eat in the
              world. If you didn’t have pizza earlier, I recommend Juliana’s – the pizza is even better than
              next-door Grimaldi’s (in fact, it was voted the best pizzeria in the entire U.S. in 2015 on TripAdvisor)
              but it’s not often in the guidebooks so there’s usually no line. If you do this, be sure to save room for
              dessert at the delicious Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory just down the street."
"If you’d rather have something different, here are a few of my favorite Brooklyn restaurants. None of
              these are within walking distance of the end of the Brooklyn Bridge so at this point you’ll want to call a
              cab/Uber or hit the subway."
"For something different, try Ethiopian at Ghenet in Park Slope. For a modern take on ramen, try
              Chuko in Prospect Heights. For upscale farm to table fare with an Italian twist, try
                Frannie’s on Flatbush Avenue (sadly, reader Bettina just informed me that Frannie’s is now
              closed – read this lovely
                eulogy to my beloved pizza place!) "
"I used to recommend Pok Pok for Thai, but that too has apparently closed (such are the
              perils about writing about a dining scene as mutable as New York’s!) I haven’t personally eaten here, but
              the new Thai restaurant Ugly Baby gets rave reviews despite the silly name. For tapas,
              I’m obsessed with La Vara. For those on a budget, you can’t go wrong with Shake Shack
                – New York’s closest attempt at imitating the perfection that is In-N-Out Burger (what, I’m a
              California girl at heart!)."
"Pretty much all of these places are within a stone’s throw of tons of fun yet relaxed bars, if you have
              any energy left after that ridiculous amount of walking I had you do. If not, head home and rest up for
              the next day."
"Start your day at Washington Square, which is the heartbeat of New York University and home to the
              famous Washington Square Arch. It’s fun to people-watch here by the giant fountain in the middle if it’s a
              sunny day."
"If you’re a dog creeper like me, head to the dog parks in the southwest
              corner to gawk at all the adorable New York canines. There’s also often plenty of street performers if
              that’s your thing. Remember to tip your performers if you enjoy their work!"
"Keep walking west on 4th Street/Washington Square South and explore the West Village. It’s easy to
              get lost here, as the streets snarl and confuse in the most delightful, Alice-in-Wonderlandian of ways…
              For example, West 4th intersects with West 10th, and Waverly Place intersects with itself. Logical."
"Walk until you’ve worked up an appetite, then find a place for brunch – that most New York of meals.. A few favorites are Westville for some unpretentious veggie-friendly
              fare, Tartine for decadent French food (which you’ll likely have to wait in line for – the
              quintessential New York experience), or Jack’s Wife Freda for delicious Middle Eastern food. Those
              on a budget can grab a delicious falafel at Taïm – I love their sweet potato falafel.
"
"But perhaps the coolest place to have lunch is at The Little Owl – which is the
              delicious restaurant beneath the apartment from Friends! If you’re a fan of the classic sitcom, you’ve got
              to make a quick lunch stop here, if not to pay homage to the show then at least to eat some delicious food
              (I love the gravy meatball sliders, yum!)"
"Alternate idea: explore the Village through your stomach! This
                Greenwich Village food tour covers the history of the Village from the perspective of a local,
              taking 3 hours and including 6 tastings, including New York classics like the hot dog, a true New York
              deli sandwich, pizza, and other secret treats that will be revealed on the day of the tour."
"»» Book
                  your Village food + walking tour here! «« "
"There aren’t too many landmarks in the West Village: mostly you’ll be gawking at the beautiful
              brownstones and philosophizing about the moral lows you’d sink to in order to be able to afford an apartment here (let’s just say
              that Friends wasn’t exactly realistic…)."
"There are a few notable historic pubs in the West Village, and that’s
              about it for sights. Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street has been the heart of the gay rights
              movement, since the riots that took place there in 1969. As you walk north towards Chelsea, stop at or
              pass by the White Horse Tavern, the former watering hole for musical and literary legends like Bob
              Dylan, Hunter S. Thompson, and Jack Kerouac. I recommend ordering a whiskey neat, no matter the time of
              day, and feeling like a BAMF."
"Keep walking north and you’ll hit the Chelsea Market on 9th Avenue and 15th street. Give a big fat
              middle finger to the Anthropologie store there, where I slowly lost my sanity working for 18 months
              (kidding/not kidding). Continue inside to some of the gourmet shops within the Chelsea Market."
"A few favorites are Fat Witch for insanely good brownies, the Chelsea Wine
                Vault for super-knowledgeable wine sellers (and sometimes free tastings!), the
              Doughnuttery for adorable mini-donuts, Heatonist for artisan hot sauces,
              Los Tacos No. 1 for surprisingly authentic and delicious tacos (certified by a
              Californian),  and Num Pang sandwich shop for delicious banh mi. "
"If you just need coffee, 9th Street Espresso has some amazing iced coffee and great espresso
              drinks. You can also go on a Chelsea
                Market food tour!"
"I recommend getting at least some sort of thing to snack on to-go, as you’ll be walking The
                Highline next. Depending on the time of year and time of day, this can alternate between lovely and
              so ridiculously crowded that it’s not anywhere close to enjoyable."
"If you need to retreat from the crowds, Terroir Wine Bar is one of the best places to day drink
              and hide from people. If the crowds aren’t so bad, enjoy the view of fancy buildings and some street art,
              and walk up to about 20th or 23rd Street."
"Exiting the Highline on 23rd street, walk east until you reach the Flatiron Building on 5th
              Avenue. This is a great spot for photos and it’s one of my favorite buildings in New York. "
"If you want a view from above, check out 230 FIFTH which has a cool rooftop bar. Drinks are
              overpriced, but it’s worth it for an epic view over the city, with an especially great view of the Empire
              State Building — New York’s most iconic."
"Keep heading north towards 42 Street. You can stop at the Morgan Library & Museum on Madison
              Avenue along the way but it’s rather expensive at about $20. But for book nerds, admission to Pierpont
              Morgan’s 1906 Library alone is worth the cost of admission. Up to you."
"From there, walk towards the New York Public Library with its
              famous twin lion statues. The architecture of the building is stunning: marble floors, ceiling murals,
              chandeliers — this ain’t your average public library, that’s for sure. The Rose Room is the most famous
              part of the library, so be sure not to miss it!"
"Finally, stop off at Grand Central Station, a New York landmark
              for its beautiful vaulted ceilings. This place is amazing for photographs and just for watching the
              chaotic symphony of New Yorkers going about their nightly commutes."
"If you feel really classy, stop for dinner at the Grand Central Oyster Bar. If
              you’re poor like the rest of us, check out this guide to some of New York’s best cheap eats (psst- this is a great time
              to visit a branch of Xi’An Famous Foods — there’s one on 45th Street!)"
"Cap off your night with a 2 hour night lights harbor cruise (better for kids) or a romantic champagne sailing cruise (better for couples) to see some gorgeous skyline views of
              New York. Keep in mind food and beverages are not included so plan accordingly."
" This post is assuming you’ll pick one of the main observation decks in midtown NYC, either Top of the
              Rock of the Empire State. I prefer the Top of the Rock because you can see the Empire State Building, my
              favorite building in the entire city. "
"However, many people prefer to go up the Empire State Building itself (or go to both). Besides the view,
              the lobby is incredible: murals of 24K gold and aluminum leaf form a beautiful art deco tapestry, and the
              Dare to Dream exhibition detailing the construction of the building is quite fascinating."
" If you visit the Empire State, I strongly recommend getting a
                skip-the-line ticket like this one. The general ticket will result in a lot of queueing and isn’t
              really worth it, especially given how little time you have in New York. For extra speediness, opt for the
              Express ticket which lets you skip all the lines and has a flex date feature so you can visit any day
              within one month of your chosen date, so in case the weather doesn’t cooperate, you can easily visit a
              different day."
"»» Book

"However, many people pick the Top of the Rock because you can get great views of the Empire State
              Building. And in my opinion, the Empire State is the best part, so if you’re going to spring for one or
              the other on your New York itinerary, make it the Top of the Rock. "
"I never did it when I lived in New York, and went for the first time
              earlier this year. It’s amazing and well worth the price, I think (just make sure you go on a good weather
              day!). Take in a view of the Empire State
                Building and the Chrysler Building and be sure to snap plenty
              of photos for Instagram so you really get your money’s worth."
"PS – the guys running the line at Top of the Rock make the TSA (American airport security) seem like
                warm, friendly puppies. Don’t take it personally. "
"Afterwards, stop by the iconic St. Patrick’s Cathedral just across the street. This is
              probably the most impressive religious structure in all of New York, and a definite must-visit regardless
              of your religion (or irreligion, as the case may be). Entry is, blissfully, free."
"Next, visit the MOMA (Museum of Modern Art). This museum is
              absolutely massive but you’d be a fool to miss it, as it has probably the best collection of
              modern art in the entire world. If Vincent van Gogh’s Starry Night isn’t being loaned out elsewhere, this
              is the place to see it! "
"They also have fantastic temporary exhibits in addition to great impressionist art. Note that if you’re
              on a budget, you can visit for free on Friday nights, so keep that in mind and maybe prioritize a visit
              then. Skip-the-line
                tickets are also available if you’re not planning to visit on a free Friday, which I definitely
              recommend investing in as the lines here can get cray."

"Next up, walk towards Columbus Circle. You can pop into the iconic Tiffany’s on
              Fifth Ave if you’re an Audrey Hepburn fan (don’t forget your danish and to-go coffee – you can skip the
              evening gloves though). The famous Plaza Hotel is another well-known
              film spot, home to works of art such as Home Alone 2  Still, the lobby is absolutely stunning,
              and definitely worth popping into."
"Foodie note: this part of New York is where culinary dreams go to die, unless you’re insanely rich and
              can afford to eat at places like Jean Georges where you’ll easily spend upwards of $100 per person.
              There’s very little in the way of good restaurants to eat around here. Most will be just above decent, but
              priced atrociously expensively. The Infatuation is my favorite guide to New York restaurants, and here are
              their
                recommendations for the culinary hellhole that is the area around Columbus Circle. I’ve never eaten
              at any of these so I can’t vouch for anything personally."
"Instead, I recommend just grabbing something simple — now might be a
              good time for some street meat, aka halal. You can’t go wrong with chicken over
              rice (if you’re extra hungry and screaming for carbs I recommend asking for a pita on top too.) Careful
              with the hot sauce – it’s super hot, and the guys will go crazy with it if you say you like it spicy. I
              don’t have any particular place to recommend, just look for somewhere relatively busy and well-trafficked.
            "
"Now that you’re fed, you’re at the gateway to Central Park. Central
              Park is almost like a city unto itself. What you do in Central Park depends on what you’re interested in.
              If it’s just people-watching and strolling, walk away — you’ve got literal miles of walkways to choose
              from. For a more scenic side, check out the Lake near the Central Park Boathouse
                Restaurant. If you’re a Beatles fan, check out Strawberry Fields,
              dedicated to John Lennon (this is where you’ll find the famous “Imagine” memorial where people often leave
              flowers). The best people-watching and chilling spot is Sheep Meadow – watch
              out for topless hippies (it is legal for ladies to be topless in NYC, FYI – #freethenipple!)."
"There’s also Belvedere Castle, the Friedsam Memorial
                Carousel, the Conservatory Garden, and the famous Alice in
                Wonderland statue — so go on a treasure hunt for these if you feel like it! If you really
              want to cover Central Park in depth, some companies offer affordable
                guided walking tours."
"After relaxing in the park for a bit, it’s time to get your culture on. The Met (short for
              the Metropolitan Museum of Art) is an absolute must-see, if not for the art, at
              least for the amazing architecture and iconic steps. "
"Admission used to be pay what you wish — as of 2018, it’s now a steep $25 for out of towners. It’s
              unfortunate, but I think it’s well worth the cost of admission, as there’s really something for everyone
              here. Since you have to pay the mandatory fee now, you might as well book
                online and skip the line for no added charge."
"There are countless things to see here, so just pick a few rooms and focus on those. There’s simply no
              way to see it all. My favorites are the Impressionists, the Egyptian section, the Native American art, and
              the insanely luxurious European applied arts on the first floor."
"If you’re not an art fan or if you have young kids in tow, the American Museum of Natural
                History is also fantastic (book
                tickets in advance here to avoid lines). "
"I’ve come here at least 10 times (hello, teacher days!) and it’s
              incredible each and every time. The dinosaur skeleton replicas cannot be missed! Also, don’t forget to
              take in a show at the Hayden Planetarium, where Neil de Grasse Tyson’s butter-like voice
              will soothe you as he takes you through a ridiculously psychedelic cosmic journey."
"By around now, it’ll probably be close to dinner time. Despite my many years living in the city, I still
              don’t know this part of town well for restaurants, so I’ll direct you to the Infatuation yet again for
              recommendations on where to eat near The
                Met or Eater for where
                to eat near the Natural History Museum."
"Both the Upper East & West Side are rather on the expensive side, so if you’re trying to save some
              cash, head down to Hell’s Kitchen east of Times Square for some delicious Thai food. I love Wondee
                Siam for traditional Thai and Larb Ubol for the spicier Thai food from the
              Isan region."
"And of course, end the night taking in the bright lights of Times Square! Yeah, Times
              Square is a bit of a shitshow, but it’s a quintessential New York itinerary stop for a reason. "
"By day, it’s easy to get angsty at the aggressive Elmos and ladies in body paint hounding you for photos,
              but at night even I find Times Square dumbfounding, and – at risk of having my New Yorker license revoked
              – a bit magical."
"Quick note: Queens is probably my favorite borough in New York. It lacks the freneticness of Manhattan
              and the relentless hipper-than-thou feel of North Brooklyn. It’s underrated as hell, and you should
              definitely save one of your 5 days in New York City for it. I’m going to lead you through all my favorite
              parts of it on a one-day epic Queens tour."
"Start your day with a scenic gondola ride in New York — all for the price of a MetroCard swipe (that’ll
              be $2.75, unless the MTA has further price-gouged since I was in NYC last June, which is quite probable).
              You’ll be taking the Roosevelt Island Tram, which has an entrance in the Upper East
              Side of Manhattan on 60th street and 2nd Avenue (closest subway stop: Lexington Ave-59th St., NQR or 456
              trains), with excellent views of both Uptown and Long Island City."
"The views are what you’re really going for, here, as Roosevelt Island isn’t that exciting – it’s just a
              residential area. If you want, you can take something called the Red Bus, which will take you around the
              island for 25 cents. Or you can just hop on the F train and make your way over to Queens."
"Start in Long Island City, the neighborhood right across from Manhattan."
" You can check out some interesting contemporary art at P.S.1 (a branch of MoMA –
              your ticket to the MoMA should get you free admission here). There used to be some amazing graffiti right
              nearby here at 5 Pointz, but they got destroyed in order to make room for condos – sadly, not that unusual
              in NYC these days."
"
Afterwards, take the quick walk over to Gantry Plaza State Park
              for some of the best views of Upper Manhattan and the 59th Street Bridge.
            "
"Hop back on the subway (or walk if you’re feeling ambitious) to the
              next museum worth seeing in Queens – the Museum of the Moving Image, which explores the
              history of cinema through interactive exhibits as well as frequent showings."
"You’re probably getting hungry – but don’t get tempted to eat just yet! Next stop is Jackson
                Heights, one of the most diverse ZIP codes in the entire United States."
"Get off the subway there and walk in a variety of different directions
              depending on what your heart desires for food. Himalayan food reigns supreme here. My favorite
              is Lhasa Fast Food which is quite literally hidden in the back of a phone shop.
              But Patola Cart‘s street stall is a close second for delicious momos (Tibetan dumplings)."
"There’s also plenty of other options: Rajbhog or Dosa
                Delight for Indian dosas and chaat, the various Mexican street carts lining Roosevelt
              Avenue between 75th and 85th street which make insanely good sandwiches (tortas/cemitas), the list goes on
              and on… Thai food is especially well-represented with a walk 10 minutes away to to nearby Elmhurst
              where Khao Kang is a standout amongst other perfectly good Thai
                choices."
"Next up is the Queens Museum at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. I know, I know,
              another museum — but stay with me here because this one is special! This hosts an entirely miniature version of New
                York City that contains almost 900,000 structures, literally every building in the city that
                existed before 1992. "
"You can continue checking out Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, which is Queens’ answer to
              Central Park. The coolest thing to see are the leftover structures from two former World’s Fairs that were
              hosted here: in addition to the mini-NYC you saw at the Queens Museum, you can also find a 12-story globe
              (the Unisphere) and a UFO-shaped pavilion."
"The New York Hall of Science is also here, and great for little kids if you happen to be
              schlepping them around with you – or if you’re a kid at heart. You could also check out
              the Queens Botanical Garden here if you are so inclined!"
"Finally, you’ll stop in my favorite part of Queens: Flushing Main Street. Exiting the train at Main
              Street-Flushing is pretty much the closest thing to going to China. It’s pandemonium for the senses in all
              the best possible ways."
"I have way too many recommendations on where to eat here, but here
              goes: Dumpling Galaxy for dumplings (or the original Tianjin
                Dumpling House located in the Golden Shopping Mall), White Bear for spicy
              wontons, Spicy & Tasty for decent Sichuan food, Nan Xiang Xiao Long
                Bao for Shanghai soup dumplings, orrrr go full Korean with some KBBQ
              at Mapo (recommended if you’re traveling with a group as KBBQ for one is a bit
              depressing, not that I speak from experience….)."
"If your feet are tired, you can get pampered with a $20 per hour foot massage at nearby Coco Spa,
              just around the corner from the Golden Shopping Mall. Just beware that they will hound you for tips and
              that $20 massage can easily become $30 if you’re a pushover like me."

                    Get Off the Beaten Path in NYC"
"*NOTE: If one of your days in New York happens to be a Saturday, shuffle around this itinerary to
                make this day your Brooklyn day so you can check out Smorgasburg and the Brooklyn Flea.* "
"Get an early start today. If you haven’t had the classic bacon egg & cheese from an NYC bodega (deli)
              yet, this is when I advise you to do so! Literally any bodega will do, even though there are better ones
              than others… but if you’ve only got 5 days in New York you’ve got to prioritize."
"Then, start the morning at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Depending on the time of year,
              you may see tulips, cherry blossoms, or beautiful fall foliage. Either way, don’t miss the
              Japanese-inspired section: super beautiful."
"After a morning stroll through the Botanic Garden, pop into the Brooklyn Museum
              (admission is suggested, so pay as you wish) for a quick perusal. They usually have some cool exhibits, so
              pick one or two floors to scan."
"Walk to the Brooklyn Public Library and marvel at the beautiful architecture and
              pop your head inside if you wish. "
"You can stroll through the farmer’s market at Grand Army Plaza just across the
              street before dipping into Prospect Park for a quick walk. "
"Next, and head to Williamsburg for the Saturday Brooklyn Flea. I recommend taking an Uber or cab,
              as subway connections between north and south Brooklyn suck since you have to transfer in Manhattan or
              take the G train, which almost never shows up except for when you’re entering the subway station and then
              you’re too late because it’s inexplicably half the length a regular subway car…. "
"Next, it’s time to check out Smorgasburg for lunch. Be sure to get there well before it
              closes at 4 PM. Smorgasburg is pretty much the birthplace of many Insta-famous food trends, like the
              notorious Ramen Burger, so be prepared to wait in line and pay a bit more than you’d like. It’s still a
              worthwhile experience for New York first-timers."
"Now it’s time to walk off all the insane concoctions you’ve put in your stomach. Luckily, some amazing
              street art isn’t far away. Kent Avenue in Williamsburg has some great murals,
              and same with nearby Wythe Avenue. For more specific information on where to find
              Williamsburg street art, check here."
"If you’re crazy for street art, you might want to head to Bushwick and
              see some more of it at the famous Bushwick Collective and more – it’s just a few
              stops over on the L train. There’s plenty of art you can see just wandering around, but if you prefer more
              structure, there are also affordable
                guided walking tours of Bushwick’s street art."
"If you’re staying in Williamsburg, you can indulge in a spot of vintage shopping, hipster spotting, and
              café hopping. Beacon’s Closet is one of NYC’s best thrift stores and it’s fun to peruse
              some of the tacky wares there. Bedford Avenue, trendy as it is, is also home to countless
              quality coffee shops (and the delicious Van Leeuwen ice cream truck!) if you need to take a break and
              rest your feet."
"To end the night, you have countless bars are your disposal in Williamsburg and Bushwick — this is pretty
              much the going out capital of young New York. Night of Joy in Williamsburg has one of my favorite
              happy hours in all of New York — daily from 5 to 8 PM with $6 delicious cocktails. "
"A few other favorites include Bar Matchless for a dive bar (also great on Two-for-Tuesday),
              Berry Park for Manhattan skyline views, and Spritzenhaus for a German beer hall feel. "
"In Bushwick, I love Heavy Woods and Cobra Club.

"New York is expensive to visit and the fact that it has virtually no off-season
              doesn’t help. Generally, the season between January-March is a bit slower because the weather is crap but
              all the Christmas tourists have left. You may be able to find a good deal on a nice hotel during those
              months, but the rest of the time, New York is expensive. "
"Virtually everywhere in Manhattan is pretty well connected, and even neighborhoods like Times Square can
              sometimes be a surprisingly affordable option at times. If you look outside of Manhattan, there are some
              deals to be found, but you may spend more of your time in transit than you like unless you’re in
              waterfront neighborhoods like Astoria, Long Island City, Williamsburg, and DUMBO. However these areas are
              all quite trendy now, so you might not even save money by staying outside of Manhattan!"
"Airbnb is an option, but keep in mind that NYC has been hit super hard
              with an apartment shortage leading to astronomical rent inflation. If you choose to use Airbnb, it’s more
              sustainable for locals if you rent out a room in their apartment rather than a full apartment, as whole
              apartments tend to be used full-time as unregulated hotels. Plus you get an insight into the fascinating
              creatures that are New Yorkers "
"Budget (around $50 a night): America is notoriously bad when it comes to hostels, and
              New York is really no exception. I’ve never stayed at a hostel in NYC, but HI New York seems to have the best blend of low budget and high ratings. Chelsea Pods has the best options for single rooms if you prefer a bit of privacy at a low
              price, but the reviews appear mixed, so do your research first."
"Mid-range: For the best savings, check out modern hotels that do away with things like
              receptionists and concierges in favor of self-check in and other automated systems. YOTEL and citizenM come to mind and both are conveniently located in Times Square
              which, for all its hecticness, is one of the most central locations for public transportation in all of
              New York. I haven’t tried a YOTEL property before but I am a big fan of citizenM having stayed at their
              location in Shoreditch, London, so that would be my personal recommendation if you can afford it."
"Luxury: There is basically no end to the amount of luxury options in New York. From
              classics like The Plaza to newer, more niche offerings like The Library Hotel, you’re spoiled for choice on this end of the spectrum.
            "
"Yes, New York is expensive, but it’s not the most expensive place I’ve ever been (here’s looking at you,
              Switzerland). Here are a few average costs so you can get an idea of what you’ll spend your money on."
"A weekly subway pass: $32A cappuccino
                at a café: $4-5Street food and super-cheat eats: $3-5 per
              mealAverage sit-down restaurant: $15-20 per meal, including tax & tip but no
              alcoholA night out: $6-7 for a beer, $8 for a mixed drink or wine, and $10-15 for a
              cocktailAverage museum entry: $15-20, but keep in mind many have pay-as-you-wish
              admission
              
"
"For an average day, I’d budget $30-50 for food (though you certainly can do with less if you research, as
              New York has a great cheap eats scene, where you can get a full meal for less than $10), $20 if you want
              to add drinks, $6 for transit, and $30 for activities. That’s $66 to 106 per day — and not even counting
              the roof over your head! "
"Depending on where you sleep (and if you’re traveling solo vs. with a partner or friends), you’ll want to
              add another $50-150 to that total – and that’s on the budget end of the spectrum. I’d say at a minimum,
              you want to budget $150 per day, but $250 would give you more wiggle room. To extrapolate out to budget
              for 5 days in NYC, you can expect to spend around $750 but you will be more comfortable with $1250. If you
              have friends to stay with, though, that will slash a lot of money off your budget."
"So there you have it — my ultimate, 6000+ word plus 5 days in New York itinerary! I’ll stop now before my
              fingers fall off. If you have a 6th day, I recommend checking out the Bronx — see a game
              at Yankee Stadium, visit the New York Botanic Garden, or
              stroll along the real Little Italy along Arthur Avenue. I have a
              whole lot more ideas covered in my 37 ways to get
                off the beaten path in NYC post."
"I hope you enjoyed this exhaustive, exhausting itinerary to seeing New York in 5 days. It’s taken me
              nearly two years to feel like I had enough distance from the city to write out a comprehensive guide that
              I think first-timers, as well as repeat visitors, will enjoy."
"If you have any questions about New York, I’m happy to give guidance in
              the comments!"
