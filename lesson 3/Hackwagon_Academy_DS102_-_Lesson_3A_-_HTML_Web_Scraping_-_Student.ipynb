       "['It’s a major oversight that I haven’t written about New York City at all in the nearly two years I’ve had\\n              this travel blog. After all, New York was my home for 9 years, and as a result I know the city better than\\n              any other in the world.',\n",
       " 'I guess New York is such an overwhelming topic, and to try to consolidate my 9 years of wisdom into a\\n              quick New York City itinerary in nearly impossible. I wanted to create an itinerary that represents a wide\\n              span of the city – not just the iconic museums and buildings, but the independent bookstores, cozy cafés,\\n              and authentic ethnic restaurants that really make New York what it is. This 5 day New York itinerary is\\n              made with first-time visitors in mind, but I think even New York veterans can find something new and\\n              exciting on this — especially on days 4 and 5, where I zero in on Queens and Brooklyn.',\n",
       " '5 days in New York City is kind of the bare minimum to get a good idea of Manhattan and still get to see\\n              a few of the other boroughs. Of course, there’s so much more you could do – 9 years in the city and I’m\\n              still discovering new sides to New York.',\n",
       " 'Note: NYC is one of the safest big cities in the U.S., but I still highly recommend having travel\\n                insurance – especially if you are from outside the U.S. Due to a lack of a\\n                national health care system, obtaining health care in the U.S. is incredibly expensive if you have an\\n                accident or medical emergency while traveling abroad. I use and personally recommend World Nomads as my travel insurance to\\n                cover me all around the world.',\n",
       " 'Your first day in New York should be about getting a feel for what makes this massive city so\\n              quintessentially New York. Union Square is as good a place as any to start – stepping off the\\n              subway here, for me, will always feel like peak New York.

The Strand on the corner of 12th\\n              and Broadway is my favorite bookstore in the world, boasting 18 miles of books. Stop in and browse the\\n              impressively curated selection of new and classic books on the ground floor, or go on a treasure hunt\\n              through the used dollar book carts out in front. There are also tons of rare first editions and\\n              leather-bound books for my fellow mega-book nerds.',\n",

       " 'Keep walking and you’ll reach Houston Street, where SoHo begins. Walk around some of the cute side\\n              streets – I especially like Crosby, Mulberry, Mott, which are parallel to Broadway but to the East.',\n",
       " 'There are countless cute boutiques to stop in if you want, but I just\\n              love the experience of walking down these streets. If you’re about due for a coffee, La Colombe on\\n              Lafayette between Prince & Houston makes some of the best espresso drinks on this planet. Book nerds\\n              like me will adore the Housing Works Bookstore & Café on Crosby between Prince & Houston as\\n              well.',\n",

       " 'Once you’ve had sufficient time to wander Soho, you’ve probably worked up an appetite. You can safely\\n              skip Little Italy as it’s rather gimmicky and has been pretty much overrun by Chinatown. If you\\n              really want pizza, may I direct you instead to the oldest pizzeria in the United States, Lombardi’s\\n              on Spring Street.',\n",
       " 'If you keep walking south, you’ll hit Canal Street which is pretty much the heart of Manhattan’s\\n              Chinatown. Try not to get lured into purchasing fake bags or sunglasses, and just gawk at the\\n              bustling atmosphere instead.',\n",

       " 'After you’ve filled up and rested your feet a bit, continue downtown. One of my favorite buildings is a\\n              residential building by Frank Gehry, the architect behind Prague’s famous Dancing House. It’s located on\\n              8 Spruce Street right by City Hall.',\n",

But I know\\n              many people want to see the Statue of Liberty as part of their New York trips, so if that’s something you\\n              want to do, I recommend booking your tour tickets in advance as they often sell out in high season\\n              (June-August and Christmas).',\n",

       "3    Note: NYC is one of the safest big cities in the U.S., but I still highly recommend having travel\\n                insurance – especially if you are from outside the U.S. Due to a lack of a\\n                national health care system, obtaining health care in the U.S. is incredibly expensive if you have an\\n                accident or medical emergency while traveling abroad. I use and personally recommend World Nomads as my travel insurance to\\n                cover me all around the world.\n",

Union Square is as good a place as any to start – stepping off the\\n              subway here, for me, will always feel like peak New York. Whirl your head around and up and marvel at the\\n              buildings around you: you’re in freaking New York City!"
